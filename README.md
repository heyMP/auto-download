# auto-download

A proof of concept demonstrating how we can progressivley enhance the mobile experience when downloading files meant for desktop users.
      
The auto-download feature will automatically start the download process for the first link with the "download" attribute set. It will also make a best guess to see if the user is on a mobile device by using the browser's user agent string. If it detects mobile it will disable the auto download feature and instead display a custom notification.
